Neural network which beats MNIST world record

Step 1. Clone repo or download program file.

Step 2. Download network https://drive.google.com/file/d/10V7ikcW1OnUbGK2e7GmB6jNLnWtyVP-9/view?usp=sharing and put it into same folder.

Step 3. Run program. You will require Pytorch and Python.

You will see accuracy that only 6 images out of 70000 is missed.
It means that accuracy is 99.9914% with error 0.00857%. Comparing to previous result with accuracy 99.87% and error 0.13% difference between errors is around 15.169 times. This is such a gap.
I think no one will beat this result in next 10 years.
